0x1805 current time service
0x2A2B current time characteristic

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need : 
           - a CTS server (use of bluez on linux explained)
                                      - start the CTS service (python script)
                                      - connect to the CTS client
           - a CTS client (the pinetime watch)


BLE Peripheral CTS sample for zephyr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the current time service.
It is based on the https://github.com/Dejvino/pinetime-hermes-firmware.
It starts advertising it's UUID, and you can connect to it.
Once connected, it will read the time from your CTS server (bluez on linux running the gatt-cts-server script in my case)



first build the image


.. code-block:: console


        $  west build -p -b ds_d6 samples/bluetooth/peripheral-cts



Using bluez on linux to connect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ds_d6 zephyr sample behaves as a peripheral: 
                          - first of all start the cts service
                           -connect to the ds_d6 with bluetoothctl
    
Using bluetoothctl:

.. code-block:: console

    #bluetoothctl
    [bluetooth]#scan on


    [NEW] Device 60:7C:9E:92:50:C1 Zephyr Peripheral Sample Long
    once you see your device
    [blueooth]#connect 60:7C:9E:92:50:C1 (the device mac address as displayed)



Howto use Bluez on linux to set up a time service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within the bluez source distribution there is an example GATT (Generic Attribute Profile)server. It advertises some standard service such as heart rate, battery ...
Koen zandberg adapted this script, so it advertises the current time :
https://github.com/bosmoment/gatt-cts/blob/master/gatt-cts-server.py


You might have to install extra packages:

.. code-block:: console

		apt-get install python-dbus 
 		apt-get install python-gi 
		apt-get install python-gobject


Howto use Android to set up a time service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As soon as a device is bonded, Pinetime will look for a CTS server (Current Time Service) on the connected device.
Here is how to do it with an Android smartphone running NRFConnect: 

Build and program the firmware on the Pinetime Install NRFConnect (https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop) 

Start NRFConnect and create a CTS server : Tap the hamburger button on the top left and select "Configure GATT server" Tap "Add service" on the bottom Select server configuration "Current Time Service" and tap OK Go back to the main screen and scan for BLE devices. A device called "PineTime" should appear Tap the button "Connect" next to the PineTime device. It should connect to the PineTime and switch to a new tab. On this tab, on the top right, there is a 3 dots button. Tap on it and select Bond. The bonding process begins, and if it is sucessful, the PineTime should update its time and display it on the screen.
